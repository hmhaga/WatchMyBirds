## Highlights

- 🎯 **Real-time detection** — Multi-stage AI pipeline (detection + classification)
- 📊 **Analytics dashboard** — Activity patterns, species statistics, temporal insights
- 🍓 **Raspberry Pi ready** — Pre-built images with WiFi setup
- 🐳 **Docker support** — One-command deployment on any server
- 🔒 **Hardened by default** — Systemd sandboxing, session auth, no root required

---

## Features

- ⭐ **Favorites & cover images** — Mark your best shots as favorites; they become species cover images
- 📹 **Live stream** — Low-latency WebRTC live view via go2rtc relay with multi-viewer support
- 📖 **Species encyclopedia** — Wikipedia descriptions for every detected species
- ✅ **Review queue** — Triage new detections — keep, reclassify, or trash in one swipe
- 🗑️ **Trash & restore** — Soft-delete with easy restore — nothing lost by accident
- 🎥 **ONVIF discovery & PTZ control** — Implements ONVIF-based IP camera discovery and PTZ control from the UI

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+ or Docker 20.10+
- Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 with 4 GB RAM minimum
- USB webcam or IP camera (RTSP/HTTP)

---

## Quickstart

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hmhaga/WatchMyBirds.git
cd WatchMyBirds
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```

> **Streaming default:** The Docker stack starts **WatchMyBirds + go2rtc** together using host networking for WebRTC compatibility.

**Before first start:**

- Set `CAMERA_URL` — the app resolves relay/direct mode automatically.
- Replace `EDIT_PASSWORD` with your own value.
- Leave `TELEGRAM_ENABLED=False` unless you also set real Telegram credentials.

**Good to know:**

- `go2rtc.yaml` is synchronized in the mounted output folder (`/output/go2rtc.yaml` in app, `/config/go2rtc.yaml` in go2rtc).
- Bridge networking is also supported — the app falls back to ffmpeg-based streaming if WebRTC is unavailable. See [`docker-compose.example.yml`](docker-compose.example.yml) for details.

### Local Development

```bash
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Recommended local/runtime target: **Python 3.12**. The Raspberry Pi pipeline now starts from a Trixie Lite golden image and bakes CPython 3.12 into that shared base once before downstream image builds create the app virtualenv.

App available at: **http://localhost:8050**

## Raspberry Pi Appliance

WatchMyBirds runs as a standalone appliance on Raspberry Pi with pre-built OS images.

### First Boot

1. Flash the image to SD card (use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/))
2. Boot the Pi — it creates an Access Point if no WiFi is configured:
   - **SSID:** `WatchMyBirds-XXXX`
   - **Password:** `watchmybirds`
3. Connect to AP and open **http://192.168.4.1:8050/setup**
4. Enter your WiFi credentials and choose an admin password for protected pages
5. Device reboots into client mode
6. Access at **http://watchmybirds.local:8050**

> Public pages stay available without login. Settings, review, delete, and other protected actions use the admin password you set during first setup.

See [rpi/README.md](rpi/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Performance

Measured with a 2560 x 1920 RTSP stream. Times vary with resolution, scene complexity, and number of detected birds.

| | Detection | Classification (per bird) | Full cycle (1 bird) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Raspberry Pi 5** (8 GB) | ~450–500 ms | ~300–400 ms | ~1.5–2.0 s |
| **Raspberry Pi 4** (4 GB) | ~1.9–2.0 s | ~1.5–1.9 s | ~3.5–5.0 s |

> 💡 Classification time scales linearly with the number of birds in the frame. A scene with 10 birds on an RPi 5 takes ~3–5 s total.

---

## Configuration

Configuration is loaded from environment variables and `settings.yaml`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CAMERA_URL` | `""` | User-facing camera RTSP/HTTP URL |
| `STREAM_SOURCE_MODE` | `auto` | Source policy: `auto`, `relay`, `direct` |
| `OUTPUT_DIR` | `/output` | Storage for images and database |
| `EDIT_PASSWORD` | `watchmybirds` | UI authentication password; Raspberry Pi appliances require you to replace this during first setup |
| `DETECTION_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `2.0` | Pause between detection cycles |

## Privacy

WatchMyBirds runs entirely on your Raspberry Pi. Nothing about your bird
activity, images, or detections ever leaves the device.

There is **one** piece of optional outbound traffic: an anonymous daily
heartbeat (off by default) that helps us count active installations. When you
opt in via **Settings → Privacy**, the app sends one small JSON payload per
UTC day to `heartbeat-wmb.starmin.de` containing:

- a random installation ID (generated locally on first opt-in)
- the app version
- the OS family (`linux` / `darwin` / `windows`)
- the architecture (`aarch64` / `x86_64` / `armv7l`)
- the CPU count and total RAM rounded to whole GB
- the Python version and detector variant in use

**Never sent:** IP, country, locale, hostname, MAC, exact RAM bytes, kernel
version, Pi model string, image data, species names, observation counts,
camera URLs, or anything else identifying you or your setup.

The data is stored in a Cloudflare D1 database with `jurisdiction=eu`
(EU-only data residency). **Individual heartbeats are deleted within 24
hours** — a nightly cron aggregates them into per-day, per-cohort counts
(no `installation_id`). Source code for both the client
(`web/services/telemetry_service.py`) and the receiving Worker
(`infra/telemetry-worker/`) is in this repository.

You can:

- Leave telemetry off (the default — no ID is generated, nothing is sent)
- Toggle it off later (pings stop instantly; ID stays so you're counted as
  the same install if you re-enable)
- Rotate your installation ID (treat next opt-in as a fresh install)
- Override the endpoint in `settings.yaml` (point it at `/dev/null` or your
  own self-hosted Worker)
- Firewall-block `heartbeat-wmb.starmin.de` at the network level

running install — no login required).
