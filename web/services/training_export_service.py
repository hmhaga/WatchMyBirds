"""Training-data export service.

Packages human-reviewed detections from the local DB into a ZIP bundle
for handoff to the upstream training dev. Only **positive samples**
(Option A strict: ``manual_species_override IS NOT NULL`` AND
``manual_bbox_review = 'correct'``) are included — hard negatives and
bbox-wrong rows stay out so the downstream training pipeline has no
extra branches to handle.

Lifecycle:
1. Every approved review event optionally lands in ``training_exports``
   with ``export_status='pending'`` (controlled by
   ``TRAINING_EXPORT_AUTO_OPT_IN``), OR the operator picks them
   explicitly via the Export modal.
2. The ZIP build path streams images + CSV, then flips the selected
   rows' ``export_status`` to ``'exported'`` and stamps
   ``exported_at`` + ``batch_id``.
3. Exported rows are EXCLUDED from future selections by default
   (prevents duplicate shipping to the dev). The UI can opt in to
   including them by passing ``include_already_exported=True``.

The CSV schema matches the dev's spec exactly:
    uuid, x1, y1, x2, y2, species, confidence_reviewer,
    station_id, timestamp_utc, reviewer_id, review_timestamp,
    source_detector_model, source_detector_confidence, uncertain

    Used by the gallery-edit "Confirm & Add to Training" batch button

    Parameters:
        auto_confirm_bbox: When True, a detection is also eligible if
            it has a species_override + active status but
            ``manual_bbox_review`` is NULL (never reviewed). The
            caller's click in the gallery counts as the bbox
            confirmation itself — the UI layer (or the blueprint) is
            responsible for actually writing ``bbox_review='correct'``
            on those rows before persisting pool membership. Rows with
            ``bbox_review='wrong'`` stay ineligible regardless, because
            flipping a prior 'wrong' to 'correct' would contradict a
            previous human call.

    **Frame-level integrity guard**: even with ``auto_confirm_bbox=True``,
    a detection is only eligible if EVERY other active detection on
    the same image has ``bbox_review='correct'`` already. Mixing
    confirmed and unreviewed bboxes on one frame would ship a frame
    to the dev whose other bboxes are ambiguous, training the OD on
    partially-labelled images. Strict frame-level integrity prevents
    that.

    Buckets:
    - ``eligible``: passes all gates; safe to mark as pending.
    - ``ineligible``: fails the species / bbox / status / frame-
      integrity gate. UI shows the operator so they know to go
      through the review queue for those rows.
    - ``already_in_pool``: has any ``training_exports`` row already
      (pending OR exported). Skipped to avoid downgrading an exported
      row back to pending.
