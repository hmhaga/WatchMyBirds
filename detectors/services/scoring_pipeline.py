    Compute all detection quality signals in one place.

    This is the **single source of truth** for the composite score formula,
    agreement score, bbox quality, unknown score, decision evaluation,
    temporal smoothing, and capability version tag.

    Two routing tracks are supported:

    - **bird track** (``is_bird_od_class(od_class_name)`` is True; this is the
      default for the legacy call signature where ``od_class_name`` is not
      supplied): CLS may have produced a ``cls_conf`` and ``top_k_confidences``.
      Score, unknown-score, decision policy all run as they did before.

    - **non-bird track** (``od_class_name`` names a garden animal like
      ``squirrel``/``cat``/``marten_mustelid``/``hedgehog``): CLS is skipped by
      the caller, so ``cls_conf`` is 0 and ``top_k_confidences`` is None.
      Score = ``od_conf``; unknown_score = 0.0 (no uncertainty pollution from
      missing CLS); decision_state = CONFIRMED iff ``od_conf >=
      non_bird_confirm_threshold`` else UNCERTAIN. The decision policy is
      intentionally bypassed because its ``unknown_score >= 0.6`` branch would
      otherwise mark every non-bird as UNKNOWN and hide it from every surface.

    When ``ENABLE_DECISION_POLICY`` is disabled in the capability registry,
    the bird track's decision evaluation and temporal smoothing are skipped
    and ``decision_state`` is set to ``None`` (legacy-compatible). Non-bird
    CONFIRMED/UNCERTAIN routing still applies because it does not go through
    the capability gate.

    Args:
        bbox:                Pixel coordinates ``(x1, y1, x2, y2)``.
        frame_shape:         Shape of the source frame ``(H, W, ...)``.
        od_conf:             Object-detection confidence.
        cls_conf:            Classification confidence (0.0 if no CLS ran).
        top_k_confidences:   Top-k class probabilities from classifier, or
                             ``None`` if classification did not run.
        decision_policy:     :class:`DecisionPolicyService` instance.
        temporal_service:    :class:`TemporalDecisionService` instance.
        capability_registry: :class:`CapabilityRegistry` instance.
        species_key:         Grouping key for temporal smoothing (species name
                             or ``"unknown"``).
        od_class_name:       OD class name from the detector output. When
                             omitted, the bird track runs (legacy behaviour).
        non_bird_confirm_threshold: Scalar fallback minimum OD confidence
                             for non-bird CONFIRMED state. Used when
                             ``non_bird_confirm_threshold_fn`` is None
                             (5-class models without a per-class block).
        non_bird_confirm_threshold_fn: Optional resolver
                             ``(od_class_name) -> float`` that returns
                             the per-class CONFIRMED floor. When set, it
                             takes precedence over the scalar. Used by
                             v2-coco-shaped models where each class has
                             its own calibrated operating point (person
                             0.30, marten 0.45, ...).

        :class:`ScoringResult` with all computed values ready for persistence.
