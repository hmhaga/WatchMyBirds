"""BirdEvent aggregation layer.

This module is the single biological aggregation unit used across the
Review surface, the Gallery sub-gallery, and the planned ``/insights``
dashboard. An *event* is a run of detections of the same species whose
timestamps fit the active event profile (30 minutes for unknown/unprofiled
species, shorter windows for station-regular or burst-prone species).

Why profiles, with a 30 minute fallback
---------------------------------------
Camera-trap research commonly uses independence windows on the order of
30 minutes to avoid inflating metrics with burst-mode serial
photographs. Treating many near-identical frames as independent
observations would bias downstream event, activity, and occupancy-style
metrics. Fixed feeder cameras also produce very species-specific local
patterns, so known short-visit species and dense feeder bursts use tighter
profiles while the 30 minute rule remains the conservative fallback.

Migration history
-----------------
This module was introduced as a reusable event library and later wired
into the Review blueprint and templates. The legacy
``core/review_core.py`` cluster builder was retired, and
``core/gallery_core.group_detections_into_observations`` now delegates
here while preserving its legacy dict shape for gallery, stream, and
analytics callers.

    """A single biological event: one species, gap <= ``gap_minutes``.

    Event instances are frozen so they can be cached, shared between
    surfaces, and passed into pure metric functions in
    ``core/biodiversity.py`` without the risk of downstream mutation.

    Fields
    ------
    event_key
        Stable string identifier derived from species, start time, and
        cover detection id. Safe to use as a DOM id or cache key.
    species
        Resolved species, or ``None`` if the event is fully unknown.
    species_source
        ``"manual"`` when at least one member carries a manual
        override, ``"classifier"`` when the species comes from the
        classifier chain, ``"unknown"`` otherwise.
    detection_ids
        Detection ids in chronological order. Always non-empty.
    photo_count
        Number of detections in the event.
    duration_sec
        Seconds between the first and last detection. ``0.0`` for
        single-detection events.
    start_time / end_time
        ``YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`` strings of the first and last member.
    cover_detection_id
        Detection id chosen to represent the event (the newest member,
        matching the existing review ordering convention.
    eligibility
        ``"event_eligible"`` when the event is a clean single-species
        run without ambiguity, ``"event_ineligible"`` otherwise.
    fallback_reason
        ``None`` when eligible. Otherwise one of ``"unknown_species"``,
        ``"partial_unknown_species"``, ``"multi_bird_ambiguity"``,
        ``"bbox_jump"``.
    touched_filenames
        Unique filenames of source images covered by this event, in
        chronological order, used by the Review image-visibility
        recompute and by the review-template filmstrip.
    bbox_trail
        Per-detection bbox snapshots with percentage coordinates and a
        ``trail_role`` label (``start`` / ``mid`` / ``step`` / ``end``)
        consumed by the motion-trail UI. Each entry also
        carries a ``context_only`` flag so the Review template can mute
        the matching cell when the bbox belongs to a Gallery anchor.
    context_only_count
        Number of members that came from
        ``fetch_review_cluster_context`` (i.e. confirmed-bird Gallery
        anchors that the Review surface treats as read-only). ``0`` for
        events that are pure-untagged. The Review blueprint drops events
        where ``context_only_count == photo_count`` because there is
        nothing left to review.
    context_anchored
        ``True`` when the event mixes at least one untagged member with
        at least one Gallery context member. Informational signal for
        the Review surface to render the "Connected to N confirmed
        frames already in the Gallery" banner. Does **not** change
        ``eligibility`` — context anchoring is a continuation hint, not
        a disqualifying reason.
    grouping_profile / event_gap_minutes / max_duration_minutes
        The behaviour profile that shaped the event boundary. Unknown or
        unprofiled species keep the 30 minute fallback; known short-visit
        or flocking species may use tighter local rules.
    representative_image_count
        Suggested number of full-size event images worth keeping once a
        retention layer exists. Metadata and thumbnails can still remain.
